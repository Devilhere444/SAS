## 🛠️ Tools Used

Professional reverse engineering tools used for decompilation:
- **objdump** (GNU Binary Utilities) - Complete disassembly
- **radare2** v5.5.0 - Binary analysis and function identification
- **strings** (GNU coreutils) - Text extraction

These are industry-standard tools used by security researchers, malware analysts, and software engineers worldwide.

## 🔐 Security Features

### Analyzed Security Features (Original Binary)
- ✅ NX (No-Execute) protection enabled
- ✅ PIE (Position Independent Executable) - ASLR compatible
- ✅ Modern Windows security features
- ❌ Stack canary protection not present
- ✅ Rust memory safety guarantees

### Repository Security
All files in this repository are:
- ✅ Non-executable text/documentation files
- ✅ Static analysis artifacts (assembly, strings, metadata)
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced
- ✅ Safe to browse and analyze

## 🎓 How to Use This Repository

### For Code Analysis
```bash
# Explore the organized structure
cd Src/

# View the main function
cat assembly/main_function.asm

# Search for specific functionality
grep -i "http\|url" analysis/strings.txt

# Check Windows API usage
cat metadata/imports.txt
```

### For Security Research
```bash
# Look for cryptographic operations
grep -i "crypt\|random" Src/assembly/disassembly.asm

# Find network operations
grep -i "socket\|connect" Src/analysis/strings.txt

# Analyze API calls
cat Src/metadata/imports.txt
```

### For Understanding Program Logic
1. Start with [`Src/README.md`](Src/README.md)
2. Read [`Src/documentation/decompilation_report.md`](Src/documentation/decompilation_report.md)
3. Review [`Src/analysis/analysis_summary.txt`](Src/analysis/analysis_summary.txt)
4. Examine [`Src/assembly/main_function.asm`](Src/assembly/main_function.asm)
5. Explore [`Src/assembly/disassembly.asm`](Src/assembly/disassembly.asm) for details
